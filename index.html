            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a PhD student in Computer Science, with a focus on the construction and analysis of clustering algorithms. My academic interests include cryptography, particularly public key cryptography and the underlying mathematical principles. Naturally, this also extends to quantum computing and low-level engineering.
                <br><br>
                In addition to my research, I enjoy participating in CTF challenges and attending hackathons, where I can apply my skills in a competitive environment. Outside of this technical work, Iâ€™m passionate about sports, especially Olympic weightlifting, which I often admire more than actively practice.
